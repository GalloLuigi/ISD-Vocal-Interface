            <div>electronic classroom classes, following online courses, and carrying out synchronous and </div>
            <div>asynchronous learning. The online tasks created permitted the students to track their pro</div>

            <div>Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) refers to communication and interaction between humans an</div>
            <div>d devices via a user interface [1]. In the current era, a significant driver of rapid ind</div>

            <div>hing via the Internet and systems for health, environmental protection, infrastructure mo</div>
            <div>nitoring, as well as security [2]. Online training becomes an integral part of higher edu</div>
            <div>cation through Internet-accessible and flexible online courses [3]. Moreover, many univer</div>
            <div>sities financial problems and student demands are focusing more on the online use of edu</div>
            <div>cation. Given the opportunity for professors, students, and institutions to receive onlin</div>
            <div>e education videos, the attention it receives is no surprise [4]. There have been many em</div>
            <div>pirical studies to examine the quality of online courses from several points of view. Cri</div>
            <div>tical questions such as communication, technology, timing, pedagogy, and assessment affec</div>
            <div>ting online learning quality have been identified and examined [5]. Some organizations fo</div>
            <div>cus on enhancing online higher education quality in resources and ongoing cooperation for</div>
            <div> curriculum development, such as the Quality and Online Learning Consortium [6]. As a res</div>
            <div>ult of the excellent quality of online education, higher education accreditation groups h</div>
            <div>ave taken notice. Establish reliable and valid performance measurements, require evidence</div>
            <div> of contact between faculty and students, mandate evidence of effective instructional tec</div>

            <div> systemic efforts to select and train faculty and ensures that students and faculty recei</div>
            <div>ve adequate training to use electronic resources. Because of this, standards for online e</div>
            <div>ducation training are essential. However, online literature needs a literature review, wh</div>
            <div>ich further synthesizes and integrates empirical studies results and gives an integrative</div>
            <div> report on online teaching challenges [7]. A wide range of difficulties concerns higher e</div>
            <div>ducation today, including distracted students, high dropout rates, and Human-computer int</div>
            <div>eraction has the drawback of requiring the learner to be taught what to perform. Unlike h</div>
            <div>umans, who need to eat, sleep and take rest periods, computers do not require any of thes</div>
            <div>e things. They simply require energy and processing power to operate. These (new) modes o</div>
            <div>f engagement put individuals under a lot of stress. They are oblivious of the interaction</div>
            <div> channel, distracted or daydreaming, or inattentive. To identify those problems, online e</div>
            <div>ducators must go through the profound task of screening through increasing literature. As</div>
            <div> a matter of fact, for many students, online learning is little more than a formality and</div>
            <div> not a meaningful substitute for traditional education. Some teachers only exchange stuff</div>
            <div> with their students without teaching it to them. Online testing is not uncommon based on</div>
            <div> the figure it out yourself premise. Students arent learning anything that will last. Is</div>
            <div>sues linked to online learners, instructors, and content development are recognized as th</div>
            <div>e three key categories of findings. Expectations and preparation for online courses were </div>
            <div>some of the difficulties raised by students. Furthermore, online research and results are</div>
            <div> increasingly critical for informing educators of the considerations and changes needed t</div>
            <div>o improve online classrooms quality. The products are high, and the progress of online c</div>
            <div>lassrooms is continuous [8]. The main objective is to provide educators with information </div>
            <div>on the central issues and strategies concerning online teaching quality in higher educati</div>
            <div>on [9]. Education objectives should be adapted to each candidate who applied. Its import</div>
            <div>ant to note that a resume objective is different from a resume summary, and if learners h</div>
            <div>ave similar work experience, a summary is a great way to highlight it. For various stakeh</div>
            <div>olders, the results are significant [19]. In particular, there is a lack of previous rese</div>
            <div>arch into how universities seek to maintain students involvement and the closure of many </div>
            <div>universities worldwide [10]. While it comes to engaging students and guiding them through</div>
            <div> college life, educators are always seeking new methods to do so, whether through honors </div>
            <div>programs, co-curricular activities, or cooperating with academics on research. The study </div>
            <div>identifies high-risk areas to enhance their educational initiatives by the relevant autho</div>
            <div>rities [11]. Higher education has continuously invested in people, systems, and capacitie</div>

            <div> engaging students in learning; Teaching involves students participation in the active b</div>

            <div>experiments, debates, and collaborative learning are all part of the process. Instruction</div>
            <div>al approaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and ins</div>

            <div>ryboard, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactiv</div>
            <div>e content. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent inter</div>
            <div>actions. Therefore, teachers must manage the atmosphere and comportment of the Classroom,</div>
            <div> prepare lessons with others, and ensure their ongoing personal development. Experimentat</div>
            <div>ion in the Classroom When a well-decorated, interesting, and engaging classroom helps stu</div>
            <div>dents think and learn more effectively. A setting that fosters creativity and stimulates </div>
            <div>learning will motivate them to explore and learn more about the subject. All teachers mus</div>
            <div>t invest in their personal growth and development to maximize their potential. A teacher </div>
            <div>can boost their growth and development in various ways. All of these strategies are used </div>
            <div>by many educators to get vital feedback and information. ICTs are a more comprehensive IT</div>
            <div> technology concept for all communications technologies, including the internet, videocon</div>
            <div>ferencing, social networking, and other media applications and services. Ensuring that st</div>
            <div>udents pay attention to training with offline learning tools and methods is easier. Some </div>
            <div>students find it easier to preserve their knowledge and skills through offline education </div>
            <div>than online learning. Students who engage in active learning are more likely to understan</div>
            <div>d what theyre learning since theyre doing things like reading, writing, or discussing o</div>
            <div>r solving an issue. When active learning approaches are used in the Classroom, students </div>
            <div>interest in learning rises. Knowledge and retention of material are improved. Active lear</div>
            <div>ning is any teaching approach in which everyone is asked to participate in the learning p</div>
            <div>rocess. Because students are actively involved in the content rather than passively liste</div>
            <div>ning, active learning enhances memory and greater understanding of the subject matter. In</div>
            <div> addition, active learning has a positive impact on equity, as lower-performing students </div>
            <div>benefit more from it than students who already have excellent grades. The learner must ac</div>
            <div>tively generate significance to learn. Learning facts and learning how to perform somethi</div>
            <div>ng are two completely separate processes that cannot be compared‚Äîlearning some things in </div>
            <div>particular to the domain or context in which it takes place. As a guideline, students gai</div>
            <div>n more knowledge by learning alongside others than by learning independently. Active lear</div>
            <div>ning contrasts with traditional modes, where students receive passive knowledge from an e</div>
            <div>xpert. In the Student diagram process, if any student starts to learn the concept with a </div>
            <div>combination of cognitive and empirical learning, it improves their skillsets. Machine lea</div>
            <div>rning models connect real-world situations that are riddled with uncertainties and flaws.</div>
            <div> It is challenging to keep the model up to date and make it smarter even when new data is</div>
            <div> pouring in. In this case, Active Learning (AL) is a viable option. Because of their expe</div>
            <div>rtise, professors and lecturers cannot prepare active learning approaches for courses and</div>
            <div> are reluctant to lower the number of students. Learning is passive and intended to provi</div>
            <div>de students with important information effectively. The learning process has six interact</div>
            <div>ing components: attention, memory, language, processing and organizing, graphomotor (writ</div>
            <div>ing), and higher-order thinking (higher-order thinking). In addition to each other, these</div>
            <div> processes interact with emotions, classroom atmosphere and behaviour, and instructors an</div>
            <div>d family members. Examples of such things include lectures, videos, and demonstrations. A</div>
            <div>lthough traditional teaching methods vary by discipline, these are the most common teachi</div>
            <div>ng methods. The development of society while learning through activities promotes adult r</div>
            <div>esponsibility. amongst teachers, play-based learning has become a prominent pedagogy. Sci</div>

            <div>proaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and inspirin</div>
            <div>g learning experience for their students and students in general. Developing the storyboa</div>
            <div>rd, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactive con</div>
            <div>tent. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent interactio</div>
            <div>ns. Learning in groups helps students to develop teamwork and social skills. The techniqu</div>
            <div>e includes role-playing, case studies, group</div>
            <div>Iprojects, think-pair-share, peer-learning, debates, just-in-time Teaching, and short cla</div>

            <div> the convenience of online learning. There was a mistake on their part.</div>
            <div>Students said that they enjoyed a well-planned working week, and they did not like "surpr</div>
            <div>ise" tasks more than they wanted in a class(Fig. 3).Personal factors are the individual f</div>
            <div>actors that influence the purchasing behaviour of consumers. These factors vary from indi</div>
            <div>vidual to individual and result in different perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of cer</div>

            <div>t, and a learner must feel supported, welcomed, and respected to maintain a secure enviro</div>
            <div>nment. However, many learning platforms and their codes do not always take the positive c</div>
            <div>limate into account or support them. A positive classroom environment contributes to bett</div>
            <div>er attention, reduces anxiety, and promotes student emotional and behavioural regulation.</div>
            <div> Interactive teaching methodology involves social networking, computing development, and </div>

            <div>ay not otherwise have the opportunity to use it and students who cannot afford the cost o</div>
            <div>f higher education. Non-traditional MOOC training is a proper online form of education th</div>
            <div>at complements traditional university education. An educator is a person who teaches a su</div>
            <div>bject or a skill from a university or college who is not a professor. The professor has a</div>
            <div> permanent role in a school with various tasks. Therefore, the instructor is an individua</div>
            <div>l training that plays the part a person plays, ensuring that they are safe and secure thr</div>

    [2]: `<div>Abstract. This paper, firstly, introduces the application trend of the integration of mul</div><div>ti-channel interactions in automotive HMI (Human Machine Interface) from complex informat</div><div>ion models faced by existing automotive HMI and describes various interaction modes. By c</div><div>omparing voice interaction and touch screen, gestures and other interaction modes, the po</div><div>tential and feasibility of voice interaction in automotive HMI experience design are conc</div><div>luded. Then, the related theories of voice interaction, identification technologies, huma</div><div>n beings cognitive models of voices and voice design methods are further explored. And t</div><div>he research priority of this paper is proposed, i.e. how to design voice interaction to c</div><div>reate more humane task-oriented dialogue scenarios to enhance interactive experiences of </div><div>automotive HMI. The specific scenarios in driving behaviors suitable for the use of voice</div><div> interaction are studied and classified, and the usability principles and key elements fo</div><div>r automotive HMI voice design are proposed according to the scenario features. Then, thro</div><div>ugh the user participatory usability testing experiment, the dialogue processes of voice </div><div>interaction in automotive HMI are defined. The logics and grammars in voice interaction a</div><div>re classified according to the experimental results, and the mental models in the interac</div><div>tion processes are analyzed. At last, the voice interaction design method to create the h</div><div>umane task-oriented dialogue scenarios in the driving environment is proposed. Keywords: </div><div>voice interaction; Automotive Human Machine Interface; driving experience; task-oriented </div><div>dialogue scenario. </div><div>Automotive intelligent interconnection and automatic driving are creating new interaction</div><div>s and experiences between drivers and cars, and people are looking forward to making ever</div><div>y trip a wonderful memory. Functions provided by high-quality experience HMI will no long</div><div>er be simple piling up of isolated and unrelated functional modules. The future HMI desig</div><div>n should be more based on user scenarios to establish the mutual linkage and intercommuni</div><div>cations between functions inside cars and provide the reasonable function jumping, and al</div><div>so based on scenario needs, choose and employ appropriate technologies and interaction mo</div><div>des, minimize the degree of distraction of drivers and maximize the information efficienc</div><div>y of the input and output data, allowing users to complete operational tasks efficiently,</div><div> easily and pleasantly. And voice interaction, as the most competitive entry in the Inter</div><div>net of Things era, creates brand new companion scenarios. In the driving environment, ful</div><div>ly grasping the feature that its inconvenient for people to use hands and eyes, voice in</div><div>teraction will not distract drivers and will not require too many efforts either to achie</div><div>ve simple operations, accurate operations and safe driving. At present, more and more aut</div><div>omotive manufacturers are actively researching and developing their own intelligent voice</div><div> products to provide more options for voice interaction in driving experiences. But only </div><div>a few high-end cars integrate voice interaction technologies into their vehicle-mounted s</div><div>ystems. Therefore, researches on the application of voice interaction in automotive HMI e</div><div>xperience design are the important direction for the future automotive HMI development.</div><div>Human machine interaction in HMI, in some sense, can be interpreted as driving tasks exec</div><div>ution. In various driving behaviors, keeping a normal driving and monitoring road hazards</div><div> are the main tasks. Other tasks that require visual resources, such as radio operation o</div><div>r telephone dialing can be seen as secondary driving tasks in a car. The major difference</div><div> between different driving tasks lies in the visual operation and manual operation demand</div><div> degree in the interactive process. From driving safety and operational accessibility per</div><div>spective, pure manual operation or manual operation dominated task is the most popular on</div><div>e, which can make the driver concentrates on finishing first level driving task in a mini</div><div>mum range of visual distraction. However, the development of information entertainment sy</div><div>stem leads to a large increase of visual oriented operational tasks. The information mode</div><div>l inside the car (Fig 1) has been gradually developed from a single automobile condition </div><div>information model into a complex information system, including car information, Car2Car i</div><div>nformation, Car2X interactive information. Under such a complex information system, the c</div><div>hallenge facing automotive HMI experience design is how to provide the driver with a bett</div><div>er interactive experience in the process of human machine interaction in addition to ensu</div><div>ring driving safety.</div><div>The essence of human machine interaction in automotive HMI design is information transmis</div><div>sion and processing. In the future, automotive HMI design will be based on scenario task,</div><div> considering the application and cooperation of different interactive channels. In the pr</div><div>ocess of task control, a certain interactive channel can be used as a main channel, combi</div><div>ning with another interactive channel, such as voice+gesture or voice+button, to give ful</div><div>l play of the interactive advantages of both channels, and smoothly complete the discrete</div><div> control tasks and the continuous control tasks. Multichannel interactive interface integ</div><div>rates voice interaction, touch screen interaction, space somatosensory interaction, eye m</div><div>ovement interaction and other various interactive modes. It brings feedback to the users </div><div>through multiple sensory channels, so as to provide more intuitive and natural interactio</div><div>n experience. It reduces the burden of excessive visual and auditory information processi</div><div>ng during driving, and balance the information into all sensory organs. </div><div>With the development of technology and society, the voice interaction has created a brand</div><div>-new syndrome scenario, and has become the most competitive entrance to the age of the in</div><div>ternet of things. It helps people to communicate with machines in a natural mode of ‚Äúchat</div><div>‚Äù, without using complex physical controls or reading tedious rules, enables the machine </div><div>to listen, speak, understand and think. Comparing the performance of touch, touch screen </div><div>and voice interaction in three perspectives of driving performance, cognitive load and vi</div><div>sual attention, we can summarize as follow (Fig 2 Non-quantitative description): it is th</div><div>e commanding height of the development of big data and cognitive computing era in the fut</div><div>ure. It has a broad market prospect and applicable significance. </div><div>Nowadays, automotive voice interaction is increasingly popular in major brands. For insta</div><div>nce, SAIC has launched the first intelligent voice cloud driving system iVoka in 2011.The</div><div>y upgrade the system in 2012, that is the second generation iVoka system. It has been app</div><div>lied to Roewe 350 and MG5, and put into market. The second generation iVoka system uses v</div><div>oice command to replace traditional keystroke, it uses voice control system to dial or ha</div><div>ng off the phone, receive or send short messages, navigate, inquire information, listen t</div><div>o music and broadcast. Ford has released SYNC vehicle information entertainment system as</div><div> early as 2007, and displayed the SYNC 3 system in International Consumer Electronics Exh</div><div>ibition in 2015. SYNC 3 system supports the powerful voice control functions, try to avoi</div><div>d driver distraction during system operation. After the connection of IPhone, SYNC 3 can </div><div>be seamlessly connected with Siri, the driver only needs to press the button of speak, th</div><div>en he can talk with Siri for help. At the same time, APP Link also supports voice control</div><div>, it can search for applications compatible with the vehicle system and establish connect</div><div>ions in the mobile phone, so as to realize the control of compatible applications through</div><div> voice. SAIC and Ali launched the ‚Äúzebra system‚Äù in 2017 on Roewe i6, although it did not</div><div> make great progress like AlphaGo, it gave the driver a quite big change. Meanwhile, in M</div><div>MC2016 (International Car Networking and Intelligent Transportation Exhibition), a forum </div><div>themed as ‚ÄúCar Voice Control and Voice Life‚Äù, some well-known voice interaction solution </div><div>providers delivered speech and made discussion, through which we can see that the applica</div><div>tion of voice control technology in vehicle system has become an important part of the ve</div><div>hicle network, voice interaction is gradually replacing traditional manual control, and b</div><div>ecoming one of the significant features of intelligent driving. This paper introduces the</div><div> features of intelligent voice control in driving scenarios, and summarizes the potential</div><div> usability problems. Through user participation usability testing experiment, it classifi</div><div>es user tasks during driving process, analyzes the usability principles and design method</div><div>s of intelligent voice interaction in driving scenarios, proposes the task-oriented dialo</div><div>gue mode, the voice control process of voice interaction, and the mental models in voice </div><div>interaction. It provides the systematic voice interaction design for automotive HMI. </div>`,

    [3]: `<div>Advances in Interactive Teaching Methodology (ITM) quickly transform higher education and</div>

    <div>Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) refers to communication and interaction between humans an</div>
    <div>d devices via a user interface [1]. In the current era, a significant driver of rapid ind</div>
    <div>ustry and information technologies development aims to exchange data and communicate anyt</div>
    <div>hing via the Internet and systems for health, environmental protection, infrastructure mo</div>
    <div>nitoring, as well as security [2]. Online training becomes an integral part of higher edu</div>
    <div>cation through Internet-accessible and flexible online courses [3]. Moreover, many univer</div>
    <div>sities financial problems and student demands are focusing more on the online use of edu</div>
    <div>cation. Given the opportunity for professors, students, and institutions to receive onlin</div>
    <div>e education videos, the attention it receives is no surprise [4]. There have been many em</div>
    <div>pirical studies to examine the quality of online courses from several points of view. Cri</div>
    <div>tical questions such as communication, technology, timing, pedagogy, and assessment affec</div>
    <div>ting online learning quality have been identified and examined [5]. Some organizations fo</div>
    <div>cus on enhancing online higher education quality in resources and ongoing cooperation for</div>
    <div> curriculum development, such as the Quality and Online Learning Consortium [6]. As a res</div>
    <div>ult of the excellent quality of online education, higher education accreditation groups h</div>
    <div>ave taken notice. Establish reliable and valid performance measurements, require evidence</div>
    <div> of contact between faculty and students, mandate evidence of effective instructional tec</div>

    <div> systemic efforts to select and train faculty and ensures that students and faculty recei</div>
    <div>ve adequate training to use electronic resources. Because of this, standards for online e</div>
    <div>ducation training are essential. However, online literature needs a literature review, wh</div>
    <div>ich further synthesizes and integrates empirical studies results and gives an integrative</div>
    <div> report on online teaching challenges [7]. A wide range of difficulties concerns higher e</div>
    <div>ducation today, including distracted students, high dropout rates, and Human-computer int</div>
    <div>eraction has the drawback of requiring the learner to be taught what to perform. Unlike h</div>
    <div>umans, who need to eat, sleep and take rest periods, computers do not require any of thes</div>
    <div>e things. They simply require energy and processing power to operate. These (new) modes o</div>
    <div>f engagement put individuals under a lot of stress. They are oblivious of the interaction</div>
    <div> channel, distracted or daydreaming, or inattentive. To identify those problems, online e</div>
    <div>ducators must go through the profound task of screening through increasing literature. As</div>
    <div> a matter of fact, for many students, online learning is little more than a formality and</div>
    <div> not a meaningful substitute for traditional education. Some teachers only exchange stuff</div>
    <div> with their students without teaching it to them. Online testing is not uncommon based on</div>
    <div> the figure it out yourself premise. Students arent learning anything that will last. Is</div>
    <div>sues linked to online learners, instructors, and content development are recognized as th</div>
    <div>e three key categories of findings. Expectations and preparation for online courses were </div>
    <div>some of the difficulties raised by students. Furthermore, online research and results are</div>
    <div> increasingly critical for informing educators of the considerations and changes needed t</div>
    <div>o improve online classrooms quality. The products are high, and the progress of online c</div>
    <div>lassrooms is continuous [8]. The main objective is to provide educators with information </div>
    <div>on the central issues and strategies concerning online teaching quality in higher educati</div>
    <div>on [9]. Education objectives should be adapted to each candidate who applied. Its import</div>
    <div>ant to note that a resume objective is different from a resume summary, and if learners h</div>
    <div>ave similar work experience, a summary is a great way to highlight it. For various stakeh</div>
    <div>olders, the results are significant [19]. In particular, there is a lack of previous rese</div>
    <div>arch into how universities seek to maintain students involvement and the closure of many </div>
    <div>universities worldwide [10]. While it comes to engaging students and guiding them through</div>
    <div> college life, educators are always seeking new methods to do so, whether through honors </div>
    <div>programs, co-curricular activities, or cooperating with academics on research. The study </div>
    <div>identifies high-risk areas to enhance their educational initiatives by the relevant autho</div>
    <div>rities [11]. Higher education has continuously invested in people, systems, and capacitie</div>
    <div>s to survive in the new normal of constant uncomfortableness even with these risks. An in</div>
    <div>stitution s ability to earn adequate revenue, and in some circumstances even exist, is in</div>
    <div> danger due to business model vulnerabilities.</div>
    <div>The importance of undertaking IT and online examinations to improve their teaching skills</div>
    <div> can be understood by lecturers [12].A courses creation and delivery include a courses </div>
    <div>materials and any revisions or new courses that need to be added to existing courses.Teac</div>
    <div>hing abilities developed by lectures include grading and assessing student learning, incl</div>
    <div>uding appropriate assignments, tests, and grading criteria.This studys findings help Hig</div>
    <div>her Education institutions provide them with significant insight into ICT integrated teac</div>
    <div>hing to better prepare lecturers to meet various requirements [13].To find the difference</div>
    <div> between various groups and attitudes towards Integrated Communication Technology in TLP </div>
    <div>(Teaching-Learning Process) [14].The findings are significant for the staff because stude</div>
    <div>nts directly contact them and deal with online management problems on a friendly basis [1</div>
    <div>5].In a similar vein, it provides educational authorities with important information on t</div>
    <div>he advantages of integrated ICT learning that enable them to include in educational refor</div>
    <div>ms [16].The primary approach commonly used in Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) is Informat</div>
    <div>ion and Communications Technology (ICT) [17].Online intervention is promising to overcome</div>
    <div> the struggles faced by the teaching community [18].An online class is an internet-based </div>
    <div>course.They are usually carried out via a learning management system to view their curric</div>
    <div>ulum and academic progress for better communication with students and their teachers [20]</div>
    <div>.The main contribution of the research is to enrich the HMI with ICT using improved analy</div>

    <div>t be a game-changer in higher education. To better understand machine learning, lets fir</div>
    <div>st take a quick look at analytics and classical statistics. Machine learning is not requi</div>
    <div>red for all predictive analytics, and it is necessary to teach them how to make machine-l</div>
    <div>earning algorithms do what they were supposed to do. Huge training data sets are gathered</div>
    <div> to educate machine-translation apps to handle idiomatic language, medical apps to detect</div>
    <div> disease, and recommendation engines to support financial decisions. The above Fig. 1 dis</div>
    <div>cussed the Percentages for Teaching &amp; Learning Methods. Teaching is defined as engagement</div>
    <div> with students to understand and apply knowledge, concepts, and processes. Teaching means</div>
    <div> engaging students in learning; Teaching involves students participation in the active b</div>
    <div>uilding of expertise. Teachers play an enormous part in the lives of their students. amon</div>
    <div>gst teachers, play-based learning has become a prominent pedagogy. Role-playing, science </div>
    <div>experiments, debates, and collaborative learning are all part of the process. Instruction</div>
    <div>al approaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and ins</div>
    <div>piring learning experience for their students and students in general. Developing the sto</div>
    <div>ryboard, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactiv</div>
    <div>e content. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent inter</div>
    <div>actions. Therefore, teachers must manage the atmosphere and comportment of the Classroom,</div>
    <div> prepare lessons with others, and ensure their ongoing personal development. Experimentat</div>
    <div>ion in the Classroom When a well-decorated, interesting, and engaging classroom helps stu</div>
    <div>dents think and learn more effectively. A setting that fosters creativity and stimulates </div>
    <div>learning will motivate them to explore and learn more about the subject. All teachers mus</div>
    <div>t invest in their personal growth and development to maximize their potential. A teacher </div>
    <div>can boost their growth and development in various ways. All of these strategies are used </div>
    <div>by many educators to get vital feedback and information. ICTs are a more comprehensive IT</div>
    <div> technology concept for all communications technologies, including the internet, videocon</div>
    <div>ferencing, social networking, and other media applications and services. Ensuring that st</div>
    <div>udents pay attention to training with offline learning tools and methods is easier. Some </div>
    <div>students find it easier to preserve their knowledge and skills through offline education </div>
    <div>than online learning. Students who engage in active learning are more likely to understan</div>
    <div>d what theyre learning since theyre doing things like reading, writing, or discussing o</div>
    <div>r solving an issue. When active learning approaches are used in the Classroom, students </div>
    <div>interest in learning rises. Knowledge and retention of material are improved. Active lear</div>
    <div>ning is any teaching approach in which everyone is asked to participate in the learning p</div>
    <div>rocess. Because students are actively involved in the content rather than passively liste</div>
    <div>ning, active learning enhances memory and greater understanding of the subject matter. In</div>
    <div> addition, active learning has a positive impact on equity, as lower-performing students </div>
    <div>benefit more from it than students who already have excellent grades. The learner must ac</div>
    <div>tively generate significance to learn. Learning facts and learning how to perform somethi</div>
    <div>ng are two completely separate processes that cannot be compared‚Äîlearning some things in </div>
    <div>particular to the domain or context in which it takes place. As a guideline, students gai</div>
    <div>n more knowledge by learning alongside others than by learning independently. Active lear</div>
    <div>ning contrasts with traditional modes, where students receive passive knowledge from an e</div>
    <div>xpert. In the Student diagram process, if any student starts to learn the concept with a </div>
    <div>combination of cognitive and empirical learning, it improves their skillsets. Machine lea</div>
    <div>rning models connect real-world situations that are riddled with uncertainties and flaws.</div>
    <div> It is challenging to keep the model up to date and make it smarter even when new data is</div>
    <div> pouring in. In this case, Active Learning (AL) is a viable option. Because of their expe</div>
    <div>rtise, professors and lecturers cannot prepare active learning approaches for courses and</div>
    <div> are reluctant to lower the number of students. Learning is passive and intended to provi</div>
    <div>de students with important information effectively. The learning process has six interact</div>
    <div>ing components: attention, memory, language, processing and organizing, graphomotor (writ</div>
    <div>ing), and higher-order thinking (higher-order thinking). In addition to each other, these</div>
    <div> processes interact with emotions, classroom atmosphere and behaviour, and instructors an</div>
    <div>d family members. Examples of such things include lectures, videos, and demonstrations. A</div>
    <div>lthough traditional teaching methods vary by discipline, these are the most common teachi</div>
    <div>ng methods. The development of society while learning through activities promotes adult r</div>
    <div>esponsibility. amongst teachers, play-based learning has become a prominent pedagogy. Sci</div>
    <div>ence experiments and collaborative learning are all part of the process. Instructional ap</div>
    <div>proaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and inspirin</div>
    <div>g learning experience for their students and students in general. Developing the storyboa</div>
    <div>rd, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactive con</div>
    <div>tent. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent interactio</div>
    <div>ns. Learning in groups helps students to develop teamwork and social skills. The techniqu</div>
    <div>e includes role-playing, case studies, group</div>
    <div>Iprojects, think-pair-share, peer-learning, debates, just-in-time Teaching, and short cla</div>
    <div>ss discussions. It provides two easy ways to promote active learning. Fig. 2 shows the pr</div>
    <div>oposed system of 3-layer architecture for the higher education system. Deep learning is a</div>
    <div>n artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the human brains data processing p</div>
    <div>rocess and creates decision-making patterns. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence </div>
    <div>subset of machine learning with unstructured networks that learn from unattended data, ca</div>
    <div>lled deep neural education or deep neural network. Deep learning is a sub-branch of AI an</div>
    <div>d ML that follows the human brains workings for processing the datasets and making effic</div>
    <div>ient decision-making. Explore your sentiments more closely on this topic. A chance to exp</div>
    <div>lore various activities The student was invited to examine the issue in depth. Collective</div>
    <div> learning can share information that peoples ideas can be stored in community memory and</div>
    <div> accumulate over generations. The complex concept of collaborative learning is different.</div>
    <div> Its generally conceived as a dynamic, cumulative, and knowledge-building process. This </div>
    <div>knowledges institutionalization consisted of structures, rules, routines, norms, discour</div>
    <div>se, and policies that guide future actions. A collective learning example can be seen whe</div>
    <div>n a lioness teaches her students to chase. Human beings are species capable of learning t</div>
    <div>ogether. The sixth threshold of increased complexity should not be defined as collective </div>
    <div>learning. If the student learns with this method, the Deep Enforcements Learning Process </div>
    <div>reflects personal factors and changes their behaviour. Behaviour change is acquired actio</div>
    <div>ns that permit students to access and interact constructively with others in the communit</div>
    <div>y. The social nature of zooming lessons appealed to some students, while others preferred</div>
    <div> the convenience of online learning. There was a mistake on their part.</div>
    <div>Students said that they enjoyed a well-planned working week, and they did not like "surpr</div>
    <div>ise" tasks more than they wanted in a class(Fig. 3).Personal factors are the individual f</div>
    <div>actors that influence the purchasing behaviour of consumers. These factors vary from indi</div>
    <div>vidual to individual and result in different perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of cer</div>
    <div>tain commodities and services. A safe platform for students is a good learning environmen</div>
    <div>t, and a learner must feel supported, welcomed, and respected to maintain a secure enviro</div>
    <div>nment. However, many learning platforms and their codes do not always take the positive c</div>
    <div>limate into account or support them. A positive classroom environment contributes to bett</div>
    <div>er attention, reduces anxiety, and promotes student emotional and behavioural regulation.</div>
    <div> Interactive teaching methodology involves social networking, computing development, and </div>
    <div>delivery. The distinctions between teacher and student are less critical with immersive l</div>
    <div>earning. The above (3) shows that the higher education systems focus on charge-free to si</div>
    <div>gn up. MOOCs offer an affordable and flexible way to learn new skills, promote your caree</div>
    <div>r, and provide global educational experiences. MOOCs may bring knowledge to students whom</div>
    <div>ay not otherwise have the opportunity to use it and students who cannot afford the cost o</div>
    <div>f higher education. Non-traditional MOOC training is a proper online form of education th</div>
    <div>at complements traditional university education. An educator is a person who teaches a su</div>
    <div>bject or a skill from a university or college who is not a professor. The professor has a</div>
    <div> permanent role in a school with various tasks. Therefore, the instructor is an individua</div>
    <div>l training that plays the part a person plays, ensuring that they are safe and secure thr</div>
    <div>ough his instructions. Tall teachers build strong connections with their students and sho</div>
    <div>w that they care for them as individuals. Great teachers are warm, affordable, enthusiast</div>
    <div>ic, and attentive. In general terms, a dialogue device is a computer that attempts to eff</div>
    <div>iciently accomplish the application objective across a range of user interactions. The pr</div>
    <div>oblems of dialogue design can be identified as enhancing a purpose by evaluating ideas fo</div>
    <div>r the accomplishment of a goal and effectiveness S is expressed in the following Eq. (1) </div>
    <div>S = ‚àëRk „ÄàSk „Äâ (1) The terms „ÄàSk„Äâ should be the estimated cost for various dimensions of d</div>

    <div>of the communication and the balances Rk Essential condition the export between costs. An</div>
    <div>y of these</div>
    <div>Measurements may be precisely calculated using the method, such as ‚àëRk„ÄàSk„Äâ. The length of</div>

    <div>veral other resources, and time of inefficiency. It is easy to define the optimization pr</div>
    <div>oblem as the function of three terms from the description of the above application is den</div>
    <div>oted in the following Eq. (2) S = Rk „Äàmk „Äâ + Rg „Äàmg „Äâ + Rh„Äàmh„Äâ (2)
        Fig. 4 shows the techn</div>
    <div>iques developed by a demonstration illustration of "Day or even Couple of weeks Dialogue"</div>
    <div>. The platform aims to determine the desired, including day period measurements from the </div>
    <div>user as quickly as possible. The first parameter is the anticipated dialogue length (the </div>
    <div>Rk„Äàmk„Äâa number of interactions). The second period is equivalent to the expected number o</div>
    <div>f words errors Rg„Äàmg„Äâ of the values received (ranges from 0 to two) and the third to the </div>
    <div>estimated range Rh„Äàmh„Äâ towards the submission target (this range is zero for completing t</div>
    <div>he application, one when the day or period is absent and two is incomplete).
        The first st</div>
    <div>atement is that a modelling approach would be assigned to transfer functionsA. Where is t</div>
    <div>he number of acts Cz + 1 as well as the number of statesCz ‚àí 1. When Cn,bz operation occu</div>
    <div>rs in good time, the Signal AD is transformed with either the corresponding Cellular auto</div>
    <div>mata function per the prediction error AD(Cz + 1|Cz,bz) expressed in the following Eq. (3</div>
    <div>)
        A(Cz+1|Cz, Cz‚àí 1, ‚Ä¶, Cn, bz, bz‚àí 1, ‚Ä¶, bn) = AD(Cz+1|Cz, bz (3)
        This method is based on</div>
    <div> the premise that although the consumer always meets the systemSz (i.e., always presents </div>
    <div>knowledge for which knows was expected to respond), and response Cz ‚àí 1, bz ‚àí 1 would be </div>
    <div>based no with any other than on the detail described by the current continuous action pai</div>
    <div>r. In our case, that is a logical assumption. The second supposition bn Relates to the st</div>
    <div>ochastic cost of modelling. When action is taken while the system is in una stateAS(Sz|Cz</div>
    <div>,bz), the feedback cost is distributed assumption in the following Eq. (4)
        A(Sz|Cz, Cz‚àí 1</div>
    <div>, ‚Ä¶, Cn, bz, bz‚àí 1, ‚Ä¶, bn) = AS(Sz|Cz, bz) (4)

    <div>tion). Where „Äà‚àëTf
        t=0Sz„Äâ the time step to the final state is reached. From Eq. (4), accur</div>
    <div>acy has increased compared to the existing system. To define the dialogue method as an ob</div>
    <div>jective feature, they must therefore allocate cost distribution to the estimated back to </div>
    <div>the estimated cost of the dialogue sessionSdetermined in the following Eq. (5)</div>
    <div>However, in Fig. 5, this enhancement increases the majority of states S(Ei); the probabil</div>
    <div>ity of transformation does not alter dramatically because depending on the method of prev</div>
    <div>ious behavior S(En), it is allocated probabilistically in its next stage S(Ein). In this </div>
    <div>scenario, value classification with the following common allocations can be described. Wh</div>
    <div>enever a problem (action, and) is raised, the system has a constant likelihood of cost Rk</div>
    <div>. The probability of transformation is expressed in the following Eq. (6) From Eq. (6), t</div>
    <div>he prediction has increased compared to the existing system. Accessible dialogue (interve</div>

    [4]: `<div>Abstract. This paper, firstly, introduces the application trend of the integration of mul</div><div>ti-channel interactions in automotive HMI (Human Machine Interface) from complex informat</div><div>ion models faced by existing automotive HMI and describes various interaction modes. By c</div><div>omparing voice interaction and touch screen, gestures and other interaction modes, the po</div><div>tential and feasibility of voice interaction in automotive HMI experience design are conc</div><div>luded. Then, the related theories of voice interaction, identification technologies, huma</div><div>n beings cognitive models of voices and voice design methods are further explored. And t</div><div>he research priority of this paper is proposed, i.e. how to design voice interaction to c</div><div>reate more humane task-oriented dialogue scenarios to enhance interactive experiences of </div><div>automotive HMI. The specific scenarios in driving behaviors suitable for the use of voice</div><div> interaction are studied and classified, and the usability principles and key elements fo</div><div>r automotive HMI voice design are proposed according to the scenario features. Then, thro</div><div>ugh the user participatory usability testing experiment, the dialogue processes of voice </div><div>interaction in automotive HMI are defined. The logics and grammars in voice interaction a</div><div>re classified according to the experimental results, and the mental models in the interac</div><div>tion processes are analyzed. At last, the voice interaction design method to create the h</div><div>umane task-oriented dialogue scenarios in the driving environment is proposed. Keywords: </div><div>voice interaction; Automotive Human Machine Interface; driving experience; task-oriented </div><div>dialogue scenario. </div><div>Automotive intelligent interconnection and automatic driving are creating new interaction</div><div>s and experiences between drivers and cars, and people are looking forward to making ever</div><div>y trip a wonderful memory. Functions provided by high-quality experience HMI will no long</div><div>er be simple piling up of isolated and unrelated functional modules. The future HMI desig</div><div>n should be more based on user scenarios to establish the mutual linkage and intercommuni</div><div>cations between functions inside cars and provide the reasonable function jumping, and al</div><div>so based on scenario needs, choose and employ appropriate technologies and interaction mo</div><div>des, minimize the degree of distraction of drivers and maximize the information efficienc</div><div>y of the input and output data, allowing users to complete operational tasks efficiently,</div><div> easily and pleasantly. And voice interaction, as the most competitive entry in the Inter</div><div>net of Things era, creates brand new companion scenarios. In the driving environment, ful</div><div>ly grasping the feature that its inconvenient for people to use hands and eyes, voice in</div><div>teraction will not distract drivers and will not require too many efforts either to achie</div><div>ve simple operations, accurate operations and safe driving. At present, more and more aut</div><div>omotive manufacturers are actively researching and developing their own intelligent voice</div><div> products to provide more options for voice interaction in driving experiences. But only </div><div>a few high-end cars integrate voice interaction technologies into their vehicle-mounted s</div><div>ystems. Therefore, researches on the application of voice interaction in automotive HMI e</div><div>xperience design are the important direction for the future automotive HMI development.</div><div>Human machine interaction in HMI, in some sense, can be interpreted as driving tasks exec</div><div>ution. In various driving behaviors, keeping a normal driving and monitoring road hazards</div><div> are the main tasks. Other tasks that require visual resources, such as radio operation o</div><div>r telephone dialing can be seen as secondary driving tasks in a car. The major difference</div><div> between different driving tasks lies in the visual operation and manual operation demand</div><div> degree in the interactive process. From driving safety and operational accessibility per</div><div>spective, pure manual operation or manual operation dominated task is the most popular on</div><div>e, which can make the driver concentrates on finishing first level driving task in a mini</div><div>mum range of visual distraction. However, the development of information entertainment sy</div><div>stem leads to a large increase of visual oriented operational tasks. The information mode</div><div>l inside the car (Fig 1) has been gradually developed from a single automobile condition </div><div>information model into a complex information system, including car information, Car2Car i</div><div>nformation, Car2X interactive information. Under such a complex information system, the c</div><div>hallenge facing automotive HMI experience design is how to provide the driver with a bett</div><div>er interactive experience in the process of human machine interaction in addition to ensu</div><div>ring driving safety.</div><div>The essence of human machine interaction in automotive HMI design is information transmis</div><div>sion and processing. In the future, automotive HMI design will be based on scenario task,</div><div> considering the application and cooperation of different interactive channels. In the pr</div><div>ocess of task control, a certain interactive channel can be used as a main channel, combi</div><div>ning with another interactive channel, such as voice+gesture or voice+button, to give ful</div><div>l play of the interactive advantages of both channels, and smoothly complete the discrete</div><div> control tasks and the continuous control tasks. Multichannel interactive interface integ</div><div>rates voice interaction, touch screen interaction, space somatosensory interaction, eye m</div><div>ovement interaction and other various interactive modes. It brings feedback to the users </div><div>through multiple sensory channels, so as to provide more intuitive and natural interactio</div><div>n experience. It reduces the burden of excessive visual and auditory information processi</div><div>ng during driving, and balance the information into all sensory organs. </div><div>With the development of technology and society, the voice interaction has created a brand</div><div>-new syndrome scenario, and has become the most competitive entrance to the age of the in</div><div>ternet of things. It helps people to communicate with machines in a natural mode of ‚Äúchat</div><div>‚Äù, without using complex physical controls or reading tedious rules, enables the machine </div><div>to listen, speak, understand and think. Comparing the performance of touch, touch screen </div><div>and voice interaction in three perspectives of driving performance, cognitive load and vi</div><div>sual attention, we can summarize as follow (Fig 2 Non-quantitative description): it is th</div><div>e commanding height of the development of big data and cognitive computing era in the fut</div><div>ure. It has a broad market prospect and applicable significance. </div><div>Nowadays, automotive voice interaction is increasingly popular in major brands. For insta</div><div>nce, SAIC has launched the first intelligent voice cloud driving system iVoka in 2011.The</div><div>y upgrade the system in 2012, that is the second generation iVoka system. It has been app</div><div>lied to Roewe 350 and MG5, and put into market. The second generation iVoka system uses v</div><div>oice command to replace traditional keystroke, it uses voice control system to dial or ha</div><div>ng off the phone, receive or send short messages, navigate, inquire information, listen t</div><div>o music and broadcast. Ford has released SYNC vehicle information entertainment system as</div><div> early as 2007, and displayed the SYNC 3 system in International Consumer Electronics Exh</div><div>ibition in 2015. SYNC 3 system supports the powerful voice control functions, try to avoi</div><div>d driver distraction during system operation. After the connection of IPhone, SYNC 3 can </div><div>be seamlessly connected with Siri, the driver only needs to press the button of speak, th</div><div>en he can talk with Siri for help. At the same time, APP Link also supports voice control</div><div>, it can search for applications compatible with the vehicle system and establish connect</div><div>ions in the mobile phone, so as to realize the control of compatible applications through</div><div> voice. SAIC and Ali launched the ‚Äúzebra system‚Äù in 2017 on Roewe i6, although it did not</div><div> make great progress like AlphaGo, it gave the driver a quite big change. Meanwhile, in M</div><div>MC2016 (International Car Networking and Intelligent Transportation Exhibition), a forum </div><div>themed as ‚ÄúCar Voice Control and Voice Life‚Äù, some well-known voice interaction solution </div><div>providers delivered speech and made discussion, through which we can see that the applica</div><div>tion of voice control technology in vehicle system has become an important part of the ve</div><div>hicle network, voice interaction is gradually replacing traditional manual control, and b</div><div>ecoming one of the significant features of intelligent driving. This paper introduces the</div><div> features of intelligent voice control in driving scenarios, and summarizes the potential</div><div> usability problems. Through user participation usability testing experiment, it classifi</div><div>es user tasks during driving process, analyzes the usability principles and design method</div><div>s of intelligent voice interaction in driving scenarios, proposes the task-oriented dialo</div><div>gue mode, the voice control process of voice interaction, and the mental models in voice </div><div>interaction. It provides the systematic voice interaction design for automotive HMI. </div>`,

            <div>pirical studies to examine the quality of online courses from several points of view. Cri</div>
            <div>tical questions such as communication, technology, timing, pedagogy, and assessment affec</div>

            <div>cus on enhancing online higher education quality in resources and ongoing cooperation for</div>
            <div> curriculum development, such as the Quality and Online Learning Consortium [6]. As a res</div>

            <div> report on online teaching challenges [7]. A wide range of difficulties concerns higher e</div>

            <div>eraction has the drawback of requiring the learner to be taught what to perform. Unlike h</div>
            <div>umans, who need to eat, sleep and take rest periods, computers do not require any of thes</div>
            <div>e things. They simply require energy and processing power to operate. These (new) modes o</div>
            <div>f engagement put individuals under a lot of stress. They are oblivious of the interaction</div>

            <div>ducators must go through the profound task of screening through increasing literature. As</div>
            <div> a matter of fact, for many students, online learning is little more than a formality and</div>
            <div> not a meaningful substitute for traditional education. Some teachers only exchange stuff</div>
            <div> with their students without teaching it to them. Online testing is not uncommon based on</div>

            <div>some of the difficulties raised by students. Furthermore, online research and results are</div>
            <div> increasingly critical for informing educators of the considerations and changes needed t</div>
            <div>o improve online classrooms quality. The products are high, and the progress of online c</div>
            <div>lassrooms is continuous [8]. The main objective is to provide educators with information </div>
            <div>on the central issues and strategies concerning online teaching quality in higher educati</div>
            <div>on [9]. Education objectives should be adapted to each candidate who applied. Its import</div>
            <div>ant to note that a resume objective is different from a resume summary, and if learners h</div>
            <div>ave similar work experience, a summary is a great way to highlight it. For various stakeh</div>
            <div>olders, the results are significant [19]. In particular, there is a lack of previous rese</div>
            <div>arch into how universities seek to maintain students involvement and the closure of many </div>
            <div>universities worldwide [10]. While it comes to engaging students and guiding them through</div>
            <div> college life, educators are always seeking new methods to do so, whether through honors </div>
            <div>programs, co-curricular activities, or cooperating with academics on research. The study </div>
            <div>identifies high-risk areas to enhance their educational initiatives by the relevant autho</div>

            <div>al approaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and ins</div>

            <div>ryboard, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactiv</div>
            <div>e content. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent inter</div>

            <div>dents think and learn more effectively. A setting that fosters creativity and stimulates </div>
            <div>learning will motivate them to explore and learn more about the subject. All teachers mus</div>
            <div>t invest in their personal growth and development to maximize their potential. A teacher </div>
            <div>can boost their growth and development in various ways. All of these strategies are used </div>
            <div>by many educators to get vital feedback and information. ICTs are a more comprehensive IT</div>
            <div> technology concept for all communications technologies, including the internet, videocon</div>
            <div>ferencing, social networking, and other media applications and services. Ensuring that st</div>
            <div>udents pay attention to training with offline learning tools and methods is easier. Some </div>
            <div>students find it easier to preserve their knowledge and skills through offline education </div>
            <div>than online learning. Students who engage in active learning are more likely to understan</div>
            <div>d what theyre learning since theyre doing things like reading, writing, or discussing o</div>
            <div>r solving an issue. When active learning approaches are used in the Classroom, students </div>
            <div>interest in learning rises. Knowledge and retention of material are improved. Active lear</div>
            <div>ning is any teaching approach in which everyone is asked to participate in the learning p</div>
            <div>rocess. Because students are actively involved in the content rather than passively liste</div>
            <div>ning, active learning enhances memory and greater understanding of the subject matter. In</div>
            <div> addition, active learning has a positive impact on equity, as lower-performing students </div>
            <div>benefit more from it than students who already have excellent grades. The learner must ac</div>
            <div>tively generate significance to learn. Learning facts and learning how to perform somethi</div>
            <div>ng are two completely separate processes that cannot be compared‚Äîlearning some things in </div>
            <div>particular to the domain or context in which it takes place. As a guideline, students gai</div>
            <div>n more knowledge by learning alongside others than by learning independently. Active lear</div>
            <div>ning contrasts with traditional modes, where students receive passive knowledge from an e</div>
            <div>xpert. In the Student diagram process, if any student starts to learn the concept with a </div>
            <div>combination of cognitive and empirical learning, it improves their skillsets. Machine lea</div>
            <div>rning models connect real-world situations that are riddled with uncertainties and flaws.</div>
            <div> It is challenging to keep the model up to date and make it smarter even when new data is</div>
            <div> pouring in. In this case, Active Learning (AL) is a viable option. Because of their expe</div>
            <div>rtise, professors and lecturers cannot prepare active learning approaches for courses and</div>
            <div> are reluctant to lower the number of students. Learning is passive and intended to provi</div>
            <div>de students with important information effectively. The learning process has six interact</div>
            <div>ing components: attention, memory, language, processing and organizing, graphomotor (writ</div>
            <div>ing), and higher-order thinking (higher-order thinking). In addition to each other, these</div>
            <div> processes interact with emotions, classroom atmosphere and behaviour, and instructors an</div>
            <div>d family members. Examples of such things include lectures, videos, and demonstrations. A</div>
            <div>lthough traditional teaching methods vary by discipline, these are the most common teachi</div>
            <div>ng methods. The development of society while learning through activities promotes adult r</div>
            <div>esponsibility. amongst teachers, play-based learning has become a prominent pedagogy. Sci</div>

            <div>proaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and inspirin</div>
            <div>g learning experience for their students and students in general. Developing the storyboa</div>
            <div>rd, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactive con</div>
            <div>tent. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent interactio</div>
            <div>ns. Learning in groups helps students to develop teamwork and social skills. The techniqu</div>
            <div>e includes role-playing, case studies, group</div>
            <div>Iprojects, think-pair-share, peer-learning, debates, just-in-time Teaching, and short cla</div>

            <div> the convenience of online learning. There was a mistake on their part.</div>
            <div>Students said that they enjoyed a well-planned working week, and they did not like "surpr</div>
            <div>ise" tasks more than they wanted in a class(Fig. 3).Personal factors are the individual f</div>

            <div>t, and a learner must feel supported, welcomed, and respected to maintain a secure enviro</div>
            <div>nment. However, many learning platforms and their codes do not always take the positive c</div>
            <div>limate into account or support them. A positive classroom environment contributes to bett</div>

            <div> Interactive teaching methodology involves social networking, computing development, and </div>

            <div>ay not otherwise have the opportunity to use it and students who cannot afford the cost o</div>
            <div>f higher education. Non-traditional MOOC training is a proper online form of education th</div>
            <div>at complements traditional university education. An educator is a person who teaches a su</div>
            <div>bject or a skill from a university or college who is not a professor. The professor has a</div>
            <div> permanent role in a school with various tasks. Therefore, the instructor is an individua</div>
            <div>l training that plays the part a person plays, ensuring that they are safe and secure thr</div>
