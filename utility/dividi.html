const text = "Interactive Teaching Methodology creates a friendly environment for the young generation to learn and understand quickly, reducing the student dropout rate in an online class. The educational system in online learning environments is unique in learning. There’s a lot of flexibility with online education, including setting a schedule that works for everyone’s needs. There’s no need to give anything up because adopting an online educational platform provides a better balance between work and academics. There has been a marked improvement in the quality of online learning since the spring. Personalize their interactions with the students by getting to know them. A student poll could be more effective than an introduction.Agent system should manage communications. The existing system uses a systematic approach with preplanned and predefined system behaviour. In upcoming development, public domain approaches contain course-related answers for learners, and data mining would be helpful if used in the same course content. Similar content is reflected in questions or subjects, making it difficult to transfer the information collected to other contexts or courses. In the future, studies could be followed with empirically learning activities during the session with the learner’s involvement; it provides prescriptions for higher education facilitators and gives guidance to the practitioners.Every teacher can use teaching strategies to increase student engagement. Up to a complete overhaul of the curriculum, course delivery, and assessment methodology. Here’s an overview of some actionable student-centred learning strategies—from simple to complex.During the teaching and learning process, the teacher-student relationship is vital to the success of the process. Interaction in the Classroom allows students to engage in class. As a result, students are more motivated and more aware of the importance of the teacher’s topic. Besides, future research provides medications for HE (higher education) educators guides facilitators (i.e., online higher mentors) on how conversational agents can be used. Personalization involves identifying the answer to the learner’s needs and providing the learner with the correct responses. It should be taken into account that the objective should be thoroughly analysed when designing a future system of chatbots to improve personalization.And used enhanced research methods to increase HMI with ICT.The invention of machine learning increased understanding and the focus of interactive learning. The machine’s HMI activity allows operations to open Fig. 11. Performance Analysis. Table 2 Comparison of Performance Analysis.
