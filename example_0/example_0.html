        <div>Advances in Interactive Teaching Methodology (ITM) quickly transform higher education and</div><div> learning where ITM incorporates web-based face-to-face instruction. If ITM policies are </div><div>expanding, teachers, lecturers, and administrators must discuss the theoretical foundatio</div><div>ns of ITM research. The intellectually enhanced ability makes more learning choices in so</div><div>me adverse circumstances. Using methods such as hands-on demonstrations, audio-visual aid</div><div>s, and regular teacher-student interaction, teachers actively involve their students in t</div><div>heir learning through interactive teaching. Students are constantly urged to take an acti</div><div>ve role in class discussions. This paper examines the Interactive Teaching Framework usin</div><div>g Human-Machine Interaction (ITFHMI) for online education in higher education systems. In</div><div> the literature survey, the critical hypotheses used in prior research are the ad hoc mod</div><div>els for embracing technologies, the performance studies of knowledge systems, the unified</div><div> ideology of ITM deployment, the utilization of technology, and the propagation of progre</div><div>ss theories. In higher education institutions’ instructional phase, sophisticated informa</div><div>tion and communication technologies with virtual technologies allow integrated collaborat</div><div>ion. This framework discusses how the MOOC platform allows organizing e-learning, taking </div><div>electronic classroom classes, following online courses, and carrying out synchronous and </div><div>asynchronous learning. The online tasks created permitted the students to track their pro</div><div>gress in all educational activities. The experiment findings helped direct a follow-up an</div><div>alysis in this area with a high acceptance rate amongst the participants. The simulation </div><div>result of the proposed method enhances performance analysis (98.27%), prediction analysis</div><div> (97.45%), accuracy analysis (96.27%), resiliency analysis (94.9%), and efficiency analys</div><div>is (98.8%).</div>
        <div>Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) refers to communication and interaction between humans an</div><div>d devices via a user interface [1]. In the current era, a significant driver of rapid ind</div><div>ustry and information technologies development aims to exchange data and communicate anyt</div><div>hing via the Internet and systems for health, environmental protection, infrastructure mo</div><div>nitoring, as well as security [2]. Online training becomes an integral part of higher edu</div><div>cation through Internet-accessible and flexible online courses [3]. Moreover, many univer</div><div>sities’ financial problems and student demands are focusing more on the online use of edu</div><div>cation. Given the opportunity for professors, students, and institutions to receive onlin</div><div>e education videos, the attention it receives is no surprise [4]. There have been many em</div><div>pirical studies to examine the quality of online courses from several points of view. Cri</div><div>tical questions such as communication, technology, timing, pedagogy, and assessment affec</div><div>ting online learning quality have been identified and examined [5]. Some organizations fo</div><div>cus on enhancing online higher education quality in resources and ongoing cooperation for</div><div> curriculum development, such as the Quality and Online Learning Consortium [6]. As a res</div><div>ult of the excellent quality of online education, higher education accreditation groups h</div><div>ave taken notice. Establish reliable and valid performance measurements, require evidence</div><div> of contact between faculty and students, mandate evidence of effective instructional tec</div><div>hniques, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation recommended in a report. Promotes</div><div> systemic efforts to select and train faculty and ensures that students and faculty recei</div><div>ve adequate training to use electronic resources. Because of this, standards for online e</div><div>ducation training are essential. However, online literature needs a literature review, wh</div><div>ich further synthesizes and integrates empirical studies results and gives an integrative</div><div> report on online teaching challenges [7]. A wide range of difficulties concerns higher e</div><div>ducation today, including distracted students, high dropout rates, and Human-computer int</div><div>eraction has the drawback of requiring the learner to be taught what to perform. Unlike h</div><div>umans, who need to eat, sleep and take rest periods, computers do not require any of thes</div><div>e things. They simply require energy and processing power to operate. These (new) modes o</div><div>f engagement put individuals under a lot of stress. They are oblivious of the interaction</div><div> channel, distracted or daydreaming, or inattentive. To identify those problems, online e</div><div>ducators must go through the profound task of screening through increasing literature. As</div><div> a matter of fact, for many students, online learning is little more than a formality and</div><div> not a meaningful substitute for traditional education. Some teachers only exchange stuff</div><div> with their students without teaching it to them. Online testing is not uncommon based on</div><div> the figure it out yourself premise. Students aren’t learning anything that will last. Is</div><div>sues linked to online learners, instructors, and content development are recognized as th</div><div>e three key categories of findings. Expectations and preparation for online courses were </div><div>some of the difficulties raised by students. Furthermore, online research and results are</div><div> increasingly critical for informing educators of the considerations and changes needed t</div><div>o improve online classrooms’ quality. The products are high, and the progress of online c</div><div>lassrooms is continuous [8]. The main objective is to provide educators with information </div><div>on the central issues and strategies concerning online teaching quality in higher educati</div><div>on [9]. Education objectives should be adapted to each candidate who applied. It’s import</div><div>ant to note that a resume objective is different from a resume summary, and if learners h</div><div>ave similar work experience, a summary is a great way to highlight it. For various stakeh</div><div>olders, the results are significant [19]. In particular, there is a lack of previous rese</div><div>arch into how universities seek to maintain students involvement and the closure of many </div><div>universities worldwide [10]. While it comes to engaging students and guiding them through</div><div> college life, educators are always seeking new methods to do so, whether through honors </div><div>programs, co-curricular activities, or cooperating with academics on research. The study </div><div>identifies high-risk areas to enhance their educational initiatives by the relevant autho</div><div>rities [11]. Higher education has continuously invested in people, systems, and capacitie</div><div>s to survive in the new normal of constant uncomfortableness even with these risks. An in</div><div>stitution s ability to earn adequate revenue, and in some circumstances even exist, is in</div><div> danger due to business model vulnerabilities.</div>
        <div>The importance of undertaking IT and online examinations to improve their teaching skills</div><div> can be understood by lecturers [12].A course’s creation and delivery include a course’s </div><div>materials and any revisions or new courses that need to be added to existing courses.Teac</div><div>hing abilities developed by lectures include grading and assessing student learning, incl</div><div>uding appropriate assignments, tests, and grading criteria.This study’s findings help Hig</div><div>her Education institutions provide them with significant insight into ICT integrated teac</div><div>hing to better prepare lecturers to meet various requirements [13].To find the difference</div><div> between various groups and attitudes towards Integrated Communication Technology in TLP </div><div>(Teaching-Learning Process) [14].The findings are significant for the staff because stude</div><div>nts directly contact them and deal with online management problems on a friendly basis [1</div><div>5].In a similar vein, it provides educational authorities with important information on t</div><div>he advantages of integrated ICT learning that enable them to include in educational refor</div><div>ms [16].The primary approach commonly used in Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) is Informat</div><div>ion and Communications Technology (ICT) [17].Online intervention is promising to overcome</div><div> the struggles faced by the teaching community [18].An online class is an internet-based </div><div>course.They are usually carried out via a learning management system to view their curric</div><div>ulum and academic progress for better communication with students and their teachers [20]</div><div>.The main contribution of the research is to enrich the HMI with ICT using improved analy</div><div>sis techniques.To better understand and improve interactive learning concentration based </div><div>on the convolution neural networks and deep learning frameworks.All the CNN models are si</div><div>milar to real-world models used to get the best results in object identification tasks, d</div><div>espite their tiny size and rapid speed.Convolutional neural networks have risen to promin</div><div>ence in recent years as a form of deep learning that is particularly promising.Machine-ba</div><div>sed on gesture HMI allows users to perform open/close, on/off, and other operations using</div><div> a model-based approach using state machines and increase overall performance, maintenanc</div><div>e and efficiency.The proposed framework improves performance.Section I introduces practic</div><div>al ICT usage, and Section II contains a detailed literature review.In Section III, the de</div><div>velopment and integration with the conversational agent system’s online learning environm</div><div>ent and its opportunities as well as constraints based on basic informal information betw</div><div>een the learner and the design with Human-Machine Interaction are discussed.The experimen</div><div>tal results are given in Section IV and Section V’s conclusion of the proposed technique.</div><div> </div>
        <div>Dr Wahab Ali [21] Statistical Package for the Social Sciences [SPSS] analysed the quantit</div><div>ative data, while the theatrical approach was used to interpret interviews with emerging </div><div>topics.Results show that the students liked a blended approach to their qualifications an</div><div>d progress in their academic and professional lives and are very well received.Classroom </div><div>instruction for all and essentially the economically and socially is a seamless combinati</div><div>on of online and face-to-face activities Dr Wahab Ali [22] proposed the Information and C</div><div>ommunications Technology [ICT] Faculty should enrich their knowledge based on the technol</div><div>ogy and technological components to improve learning.Word bank is adopting online learnin</div><div>g, and the staff has to understand the usage of ICT tools, that the course can be taught </div><div>effectively based on the platform they like.Charles et al. [23] proposed practical usage </div><div>of ICT &amp; correlation between male/female teachers.Female lecturers for evaluation purpose</div><div>s use ICT significantly better than males (mean=0.59, std=0.798).A correlation analysis s</div><div>howed that the teacher’s computer skills, experience, and access are positively correlate</div><div>d (r=0.59, p&lt;0.001; r=0.65, p&lt;0.001).Finally, computer access was the most vital determin</div><div>ant of teachers’ computer skills (β=42).</div>
        <div>Xu He et al.[24] introduced SLSS-SC for super-light solid-state supercapacitor[SLSS-SC]. </div><div>This paper-based system is further developed via a signal processing circuit into the eco</div><div>nomical, environmentally friendly HMI system for document management, reading, and effici</div><div>ent data identification using TENG’s single-electrode mode. Lim et al.[25] analysed the r</div><div>esults of students who had been the most active in their activities, and the instructor’s</div><div> feedback approach was aligned with the principles of efficient fees. This report examine</div><div>s and focuses group data from four courses to appreciate student personalized feedback’s </div><div>sensitivity based on the analysis. Developing and designing an intelligent machine that p</div><div>romotes interaction between the learners’ systems for their reflecting duties in online c</div><div>lasses addresses the low level of online students’ interaction possibilities. To encourag</div><div>e their learning performance, it provides system efficiency through the chat.</div>
        <div>Interactive classrooms improvise student learning measures. A meta-analysed student exami</div><div>nation results have improved in STEM classrooms with a broad definition of active learnin</div><div>g. Teachers must communicate the benefits of interactive learning to students by citing g</div><div>eneral reasons. Adopting a data-science tool that relies heavily on machine learning migh</div><div>t be a game-changer in higher education. To better understand machine learning, let’s fir</div><div>st take a quick look at analytics and classical statistics. Machine learning is not requi</div><div>red for all predictive analytics, and it is necessary to teach them how to make machine-l</div><div>earning algorithms do what they were supposed to do. Huge training data sets are gathered</div><div> to educate machine-translation apps to handle idiomatic language, medical apps to detect</div><div> disease, and recommendation engines to support financial decisions. The above Fig. 1 dis</div><div>cussed the Percentages for Teaching &amp; Learning Methods. Teaching is defined as engagement</div><div> with students to understand and apply knowledge, concepts, and processes. Teaching means</div><div> engaging students in learning; Teaching involves students’ participation in the active b</div><div>uilding of expertise. Teachers play an enormous part in the lives of their students. amon</div><div>gst teachers, play-based learning has become a prominent pedagogy. Role-playing, science </div><div>experiments, debates, and collaborative learning are all part of the process. Instruction</div><div>al approaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and ins</div><div>piring learning experience for their students and students in general. Developing the sto</div><div>ryboard, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactiv</div><div>e content. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent inter</div><div>actions. Therefore, teachers must manage the atmosphere and comportment of the Classroom,</div><div> prepare lessons with others, and ensure their ongoing personal development. Experimentat</div><div>ion in the Classroom When a well-decorated, interesting, and engaging classroom helps stu</div><div>dents think and learn more effectively. A setting that fosters creativity and stimulates </div><div>learning will motivate them to explore and learn more about the subject. All teachers mus</div><div>t invest in their personal growth and development to maximize their potential. A teacher </div><div>can boost their growth and development in various ways. All of these strategies are used </div><div>by many educators to get vital feedback and information. ICTs are a more comprehensive IT</div><div> technology concept for all communications technologies, including the internet, videocon</div><div>ferencing, social networking, and other media applications and services. Ensuring that st</div><div>udents pay attention to training with offline learning tools and methods is easier. Some </div><div>students find it easier to preserve their knowledge and skills through offline education </div><div>than online learning. Students who engage in active learning are more likely to understan</div><div>d what they’re learning since they’re doing things like reading, writing, or discussing o</div><div>r solving an issue. When active learning approaches are used in the Classroom, students’ </div><div>interest in learning rises. Knowledge and retention of material are improved. Active lear</div><div>ning is any teaching approach in which everyone is asked to participate in the learning p</div><div>rocess. Because students are actively involved in the content rather than passively liste</div><div>ning, active learning enhances memory and greater understanding of the subject matter. In</div><div> addition, active learning has a positive impact on equity, as lower-performing students </div><div>benefit more from it than students who already have excellent grades. The learner must ac</div><div>tively generate significance to learn. Learning facts and learning how to perform somethi</div><div>ng are two completely separate processes that cannot be compared—learning some things in </div><div>particular to the domain or context in which it takes place. As a guideline, students gai</div><div>n more knowledge by learning alongside others than by learning independently. Active lear</div><div>ning contrasts with traditional modes, where students receive passive knowledge from an e</div><div>xpert. In the Student diagram process, if any student starts to learn the concept with a </div><div>combination of cognitive and empirical learning, it improves their skillsets. Machine lea</div><div>rning models connect real-world situations that are riddled with uncertainties and flaws.</div><div> It is challenging to keep the model up to date and make it smarter even when new data is</div><div> pouring in. In this case, Active Learning (AL) is a viable option. Because of their expe</div><div>rtise, professors and lecturers cannot prepare active learning approaches for courses and</div><div> are reluctant to lower the number of students. Learning is passive and intended to provi</div><div>de students with important information effectively. The learning process has six interact</div><div>ing components: attention, memory, language, processing and organizing, graphomotor (writ</div><div>ing), and higher-order thinking (higher-order thinking). In addition to each other, these</div><div> processes interact with emotions, classroom atmosphere and behaviour, and instructors an</div><div>d family members. Examples of such things include lectures, videos, and demonstrations. A</div><div>lthough traditional teaching methods vary by discipline, these are the most common teachi</div><div>ng methods. The development of society while learning through activities promotes adult r</div><div>esponsibility. amongst teachers, play-based learning has become a prominent pedagogy. Sci</div><div>ence experiments and collaborative learning are all part of the process. Instructional ap</div><div>proaches and techniques should be employed creatively to provide an engaging and inspirin</div><div>g learning experience for their students and students in general. Developing the storyboa</div><div>rd, which must be based on entertaining learning programs, is critical to interactive con</div><div>tent. To maintain attention and increase learning, learners must have frequent interactio</div><div>ns. Learning in groups helps students to develop teamwork and social skills. The techniqu</div><div>e includes role-playing, case studies, group</div>
        <div>Iprojects, think-pair-share, peer-learning, debates, just-in-time Teaching, and short cla</div><div>ss discussions. It provides two easy ways to promote active learning. Fig. 2 shows the pr</div><div>oposed system of 3-layer architecture for the higher education system. Deep learning is a</div><div>n artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the human brain’s data processing p</div><div>rocess and creates decision-making patterns. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence </div><div>subset of machine learning with unstructured networks that learn from unattended data, ca</div><div>lled deep neural education or deep neural network. Deep learning is a sub-branch of AI an</div><div>d ML that follows the human brain’s workings for processing the datasets and making effic</div><div>ient decision-making. Explore your sentiments more closely on this topic. A chance to exp</div><div>lore various activities The student was invited to examine the issue in depth. Collective</div><div> learning can share information that people’s ideas can be stored in community memory and</div><div> accumulate over generations. The complex concept of collaborative learning is different.</div><div> It’s generally conceived as a dynamic, cumulative, and knowledge-building process. This </div><div>knowledge’s institutionalization consisted of structures, rules, routines, norms, discour</div><div>se, and policies that guide future actions. A collective learning example can be seen whe</div><div>n a lioness teaches her students to chase. Human beings are species capable of learning t</div><div>ogether. The sixth threshold of increased complexity should not be defined as collective </div><div>learning. If the student learns with this method, the Deep Enforcements Learning Process </div><div>reflects personal factors and changes their behaviour. Behaviour change is acquired actio</div><div>ns that permit students to access and interact constructively with others in the communit</div><div>y. The social nature of zooming lessons appealed to some students, while others preferred</div><div> the convenience of online learning. There was a mistake on their part.</div></div>
